HackathonPack
This is my pack with all my submissions for the [ProjectKorra](https://github.com/ProjectKorra/ProjectKorra) Sub Element Hackathon competition in 2023. 

[![Github release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Aztlon/Azutoru)](https://github.com/Aztlon/Azutoru/releases)
![Size](https://img.shields.io/github/repo-size/Aztlon/Azutoru.svg)
![Last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/Aztlon/Azutoru.svg)

About Hackathon Pack
What sub elements are in it?
There are four sub elements, one of which is a custom sub element for Chi, called Techno. The other three are Ice, sub element of Water, Sand, sub element of Earth and Metal, sub element of Earth. I felt sand did not have a lot of representation throughout core, and well all addon ability making as there was no core sand moves and very little addon moves. Techno is based off Book 1 Legend of Korra equalist chi-blocking with the high tech gadgets. In the Abilities section, after the desciption I have posted the inspiration and proof of it's canonicity.

Abilities
Sand
QuickSand
QuickSand is an ability we see throughout the show, mostly by Bumi in his fight with Aang in the Omashu undergrounds. It's activation is shift click. ![8C35333E-457C-4CAE-A80C-5EE16F43A7CC](https://github.com/slokxo/HackathonPack/assets/121277761/fad3a8e5-ba57-4f96-b77a-30a7ff932cc6).
SandSlash
SandSlash is a standard combo used by sandenders (probably).. While we do not see it in the show, it is a very simple ability and if sandbenders can not do it.. well they're dumb! Just kidding, but it is very realistic and I think that they could do it.
Ice
IceGrip
IceGrip is a move that allows you to send out a cutting whip of ice and water, whoever gets hit with it will be encased in ice and eventually topple over! ![image](https://github.com/slokxo/HackathonPack/assets/121277761/2b36d9d8-970e-48d2-92a4-03f776be327c)
IceDiscs
IceDiscs allows the player to aise a stump of ice and shoot a disc out of it. ![tumblr_mr98w81aAg1rfr4i6o1_500](https://github.com/slokxo/HackathonPack/assets/121277761/80e0302d-9278-48f3-8657-65d0189659b3)
Techno
GrapplingHook
While GrapplingHook is not explicitly canon, it's been mentioned before. it allows the user to gain a grapple hook and wherever they shoot, they get pulled to it and the hook retracts! ![image (18)](https://github.com/slokxo/HackathonPack/assets/121277761/54334001-3f7e-4ecb-8cd4-bfb930d1a874) <-- We also see Sokka tie his boomerang to a rope to make a makeshift grappling hook in the northern air temple episode
EMPGrenade
EMPGrenade allows the user to send ou ta grenade of Electonic Magnetic Pulses that will disable any grappling hook gadgets within the area and damage. <-- Honestly, this wasn't canon, I was just bored but, you could argue that it could be made, taking into account Book 1's technological development. tHEY HAD TASERS AND SMOKE BOMBS, SO WHY NOT COMBINE.. :)
Metal
MetalRun
MetalRun is like JedCore's WallRuhn, but you can shoot yourself off!

Additional Information
Discord?
You can contact me on discord at @slokx.

I also want to say, I do not expect to win, I am very new to the Spigot API, ProjectKorra and well java coding. I entered this to gain experience, and I got it. IceGrip was probably my most advanced move ever lol.. The Hackathon isn't about winning either, it's about providing moves for the community, and I did just that :)

## Commands
I have also made a few commands for this pack:
- `/b hackathonpack/hp/hackathon` will tell you a full list of them and their syntax.
- `/b hp reload` will reload the config for you, applying all edited values from the `config.yml` (found inside the HackathonPack) folder.
- `/b hp config` was originally made for testing purposes to see if my config actually worked but I decided to keep it since it could be useful. Beware though, it spams your chat with all the config values.
- `/actionb / actionbar / showhealth` will toggle a action bar to be sent to you. Inside that bar, will be the targeted entities health! (It will toggle when you use GrapplingHook)

> Help

I would like to thank everyone that helped me in the Project Korra [development support](https://discord.com/channels/292809844803502080/612873490709741577) in the making of this pack, but more specifically, I would like to thank `@Aztl` and `@DreamerBoy` to help me make it. Without their help I wouldn't have made half of these moves.. <3 ty baes, and also thanks to `@MrHobo` for proving some of these moves canonicity with proof <3, As well as ProjectKorra's code.

Only EMPGrenade is not canon, the other *6* are canon and I will gladly debate so.

I also want to say, I do not expect to win, I am very new to the Spigot API, ProjectKorra and well, Java coding. I entered this to gain experience, and, experience is what I got it. Half of these moves are probably my most advanced move ever lol.. The Hackathon isn't about winning either, it's about providing moves for the community, and I did just that :)
